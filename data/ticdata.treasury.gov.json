Nationality-based data are available from the Federal Reserve Board staff for 2003-2022. These FRB staff data are based on the nationality of the issuer of the foreign security; in contrast the TIC report on U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities is based on the residence of the issuer of the security. See section 1.a on the Securities(C) webpage. (line 2.c above)   (03-15-2023) Notice: The April 17 Release will begin new data on cross-border transactions in long-term securities (line 2.a above). The changes are related to the discontinuation of TIC Form S, “Purchases and Sales of Long-Term Securities by Foreign-Residents,” and the beginning of the revised and expanded TIC Form SLT, “Aggregate Holdings, Purchases and Sales, and Fair Value Changes of Long-Term Securities by U.S. and Foreign Residents.”  There will be several important changes in the data. The new SLT-based data will be presented from the U.S. point of view, not from the foreign point of view of the S data. In addition, there will be an important change in the data on foreign securities -- U.S. purchases and sales of foreign securities for a given country will refer to securities issued by that country, in contrast to the current breakdown showing the amounts of all foreign securities bought and sold in each country, regardless of the country of issuance. Later this month, the TIC website will post templates of the new files that will be released on April 17.     TIC reporting and file formats on banking claims and liabilities, derivatives, and claims and liabilities of nonfinancial firms remain unchanged.   (09-16-2021) Notice of a series break: This month’s data release includes significant revisions to holdings of long-term securities for June 2021. These revisions affect data on the Securities(B) webpage. (line 2.b above), including the table on major foreign holders of Treasury securities, and are described in footnote #5 on that webpage.   (03-13-2021). The TIC Web site has been redesigned slightly and activated this past week. We invite users to inform us of any missing or broken links.  -- Update your Bookmarks. If you use a bookmark in your browser to go to a certain webpage, you will open a redirect-page that says something like \"this page has been moved\". Clicking on the word \"moved\" will take you to the new webpage. Then you can change your bookmark to go to the new url location.  -- The new webpages are exactly like the previous ones, except:  (a) the text is larger so more scrolling will be required; and  (b) the grey help-bar that was across the top of the old webpages has been renamed \"Contact TIC and Using TIC\", and moved into the left-hand column, under the section name \"Treasury International Capital (TIC) System Home Page\". On those webpages without a left-hand column, there is an equivalent button at the top of the page called \"Contact TIC & Using TIC\".   (06-25-2020). Data for 2018 and a Federal Reserve paper on Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are available in section 4.a of the Securities(C) webpage (line 2.c above).   (5-16-2016). Country data now replace certain aggregates (such as oil exporters and Caribbean banking centers) previously used in data on holdings of Treasury securities. See section A.2.c on the Securities(b) webpage (line 2.b above). Also see the Press Release dated 05/16/2016.   (4-15-2015) Starting with the April 15, 2015 release of monthly TIC data, the tables have been adjusted to cover a larger number of countries for data beginning in January 2015. The lists vary by data category; see the country list for each category, such as the list for the Securities(A) webpage Monthly Transactions in Long-term Securities.",
