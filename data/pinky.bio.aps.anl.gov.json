Learn More Proteins May Prevent Dysfunction and Disease by Relaxing Learn More Unearthing the Mechanism of the Frank-Starling Law Recent X-ray diffraction experiments show that the protein titin is critically important for transmitting the stretch-induced signals within the heart’s muscles known to impact the strength with which the heart contracts. This work not only solves a piece of the mystery of how the frank-Starling law determines cardiac function, but provides an avenue for targeted development of drugs to treat heart failure.
